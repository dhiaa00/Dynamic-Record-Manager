# Dynamic-Record-Manager
## Overview
This Python school project offers dynamic record management, facilitating efficient handling of record additions, deletions, modifications, sorting, searching, and file handling. It provides a versatile solution for streamlined data management by offering advanced binary file management capabilities with support for indexes and overflow areas. Users can create and manage binary files with fixed-size records and custom-defined fields efficiently. The program implements two types of indexes (ordered and unordered) for optimized record retrieval and supports operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion of records. Additionally, it seamlessly handles both primary file management and overflow areas, offering flexibility in record deletion and reorganization.

## Key Features

- Creates and manages binary files with fixed-size records and user-defined fields.
- Implements ordered and unordered indexes for efficient record retrieval.
- Supports searching, insertion, and deletion of records.
- Handles both primary file and overflow areas, optimizing layout and minimizing wasted space.
- Supports physical and logical record deletion for flexibility.
- Performs file reorganization to optimize layout and minimize waste space.
- Employs a dedicated overflow area to accommodate records exceeding block capacity.

## Technical Highlights

- Utilizes Pickle for data serialization/deserialization.
- Leverages generic functions for streamlined block read/write operations.
- Prioritizes flexibility and extensibility for adapting to diverse data structures and applications.
